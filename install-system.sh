#!/bin/bash
# Install (or remove) the system components of io.github.nipsen.dell-power.
#
# Usage (as your regular user — the script elevates only the authenticated
# installer core, via sudo):
#   ./install-system.sh               install
#   ./install-system.sh --uninstall   removal
#
# Provenance model (marketplace security review):
#   * This wrapper is UNPRIVILEGED. Root never opens or reads a path from
#     this user-writable checkout.
#   * The privileged core (system/installer.py) is fetched over HTTPS from
#     the publisher repo at this checkout's HEAD commit, and its SHA-256 is
#     verified against the publisher manifest (SHA256SUMS) fetched from the
#     same commit BEFORE any privilege is granted. Only bytes matching a
#     commit actually pushed to github.com/NIPSEN/omarchy-dell-power run as
#     root; a checkout with uncommitted/unpushed changes fails closed.
#   * The authenticated program is handed to the interpreter through an
#     anonymous pipe — no mutable pathname crosses the privilege boundary.
#   * All tools are invoked by absolute path (no inherited PATH lookup).
#
# After changing a payload or the core, regenerate the manifest, commit and
# push (installs only succeed at a pushed commit):
#   sha256sum system/installer.py system/dell-charge-limit \
#     system/*.policy system/*.service > SHA256SUMS
